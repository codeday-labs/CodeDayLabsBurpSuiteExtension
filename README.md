# API routes and Response Burp Suite Extension

This Burp Suite Extension gives HTTP request history and the different types of responses for the request. We have parsed the HTTP requests and filtered the unique API routes. At the same time, this extension reports the different types of responses(200s, 400s, 500s etc) for the HTTP requests.
